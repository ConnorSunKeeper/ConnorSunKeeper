- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConnorSunKeeper
- 👀 I’m interested in game design, game audio, game art, sound design, and music composition, production and orchestration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and C# to support these interests, while completing my Bachelor's degree in Game Design Art in the next year.
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on Harry Potter Mod for Teardown in 2022, and I'm in planning stages for an indie adventure game with my partner, who is a Senior Software Engineer
